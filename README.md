## Classifying Household Poverty Levels with Multinomial Logistic Regression
###  This project aims to create a model to classify a household into one of four poverty levels. To do this we will be looking at information for the head of each household. The main motivation behind this comes from the fact that many poverty stricken households lack the resources or capability to report their income, making it difficult for social programs to properly give out aid. Our model will be using observable household attributes rather than income to classify households into poverty levels. To do this we started by analyzing relationships between predictor variables as well as between predictors and poverty levels. We then came up with our baseline model, and put it through backward elimination to come up with our final model.
